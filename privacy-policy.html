                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p><strong>Last Updated: 31 October 2025</strong></p>
                <p>Test™ is a web application designed for the secure management of passwords, credit/debit cards, and digital wallets. Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle (or do not handle) your data.</p>

                <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection</strong>: Test™ does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to external servers. All data entered (e.g., passwords, cards, wallets) is saved locally in an encrypted JSON file on your device. Uploaded data is processed temporarily in your browser's memory during the active session and is automatically deleted upon closing or reloading the page, without the use of persistent storage such as localStorage or sessionStorage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: We do not use any cookies. See our <a href="cookie-policy.html?v=4.5.2">Cookie Policy</a> for details.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Data Security</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Encryption</strong>: Data saved in JSON files is encrypted using the AES-256-GCM algorithm via the Web Crypto API. The encryption key is derived from your password, and no data leaves your device.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Responsibility</strong>: You are responsible for securing the exported JSON file. We recommend storing it in a secure location (e.g., a protected device or encrypted cloud storage).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Third-Party Libraries</h3>
                <p>We use <strong>FontAwesome</strong> for icons, integrated locally without cookies or tracking.</p>

                <h3>4. User Rights</h3>
                <p>Since we do not collect personal data, requests for access, rectification, or deletion under GDPR or CCPA do not apply. You can manage your data directly by editing or deleting the JSON file.</p>

                <h3>5. Liability and Purpose</h3>
                <p>Test™ is not responsible for any data loss, corruption, or accidental deletion. The user is fully responsible for maintaining backups and safeguarding their encrypted files. The purpose of Test™ is solely to graphically display the user's credentials (such as passwords, cards, and wallets) in a secure and user-friendly interface on their local device. The application does not provide online storage or remote data recovery functionalities.</p>

                <h3>6. Licence and Trademark</h3>
                <p>Test™ is released under the custom licence of Amal Pecoraro.
